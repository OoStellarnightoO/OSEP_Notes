# OSEP_Notes

This set of notes were used for my OSEP exam taken on July 2025. 

There is probably a fair amount of overlap between the Checklist and the individual sections because the checklist was something prepared in the days leading up the my actual exam. 

The easiest way to bypass OSEP AV is to make custom meterpreter shellcode (via caesar ciphers or multi byte XOR), using randomised obfuscators like Invoke-PSObfuscation, or doing simple things like renaming variables like $buf into maybe $b_ because the AV is signature based.

## Great Resources

**Chvancooten OSEP Code Repo**

A famous and convenient repo for OSEP. This is a good starting point and is often referenced by other students and Student Mentors in the Offsec Discord channel.

[Chvancooten OSEP Code Repo](https://github.com/chvancooten/OSEP-Code-Snippets)

**Invoke-PSObfuscation**

Singlehandedly the most important tool I discovered for the OSEP. Obfuscates your powershell shellcode and gets pass OSEP AV....100% of the time if you can get the host to execute powershell scripts.
Almost feels like cheating and makes bypassing OSEP AV trivial

In particular, I made great use of the Get-ShellCode repo referred to in the repo for my powershell shellcode runner

[Invoke-PSObfuscation](https://github.com/gh0x0st/Invoke-PSObfuscation/tree/main)

**Hacker-Recipies for AD Movement and Recon**

Very useful resource for commands related to AD lateral movement. The commands that are given in Bloodhound-CE are ...not always correct. Use this website to check for both linux and windows options to abuse AD misconfigurations

**ired-team**

Yet another great resource to reference
